    title: "Understanding Maximum Heart Rate",
    explanation:
      "Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is the highest heart rate an individual can achieve during Maximum physical exertion. It's a crucial metric for tailoring workout intensity and understanding cardiovascular capacity. Knowing your MHR helps in structuring training sessions to maximize efficiency and safety.",

    title: "Methods to Determine Your Maximum Heart Rate",
    explanation:
      "There are various methods to determine MHR, including theoretical calculations and empirical testing. Each method offers different levels of accuracy and practicality, from quick estimates to detailed, personalized testing.",

        title: "Theoretical Calculation",
        explanation:
          "Theoretical calculations provide a quick way to estimate MHR using formulas such as 220-minus-age or the Tanaka formula. While convenient, these methods may not account for individual variations and are less accurate than empirical testing.",

            title: "The 220-minus-age Formula",
            explanation:
              "A simple estimation of MHR is achieved by subtracting your age from 220. This method offers a general approximation but can vary significantly from actual Maximum heart rates.",

          {

            title: "The Tanaka Formula",
            explanation:
              "The Tanaka formula, calculated as 208 - (0.7 Ã— age), provides a refined estimate of MHR, offering closer approximations for a wider age range compared to the 220-minus-age formula.",

        title: "Empirical Testing",
        explanation:
          "Empirical testing methods, including Graded Exercise Tests (GET) and field tests, measure MHR through actual physical exertion. These tests are more accurate and personalized, reflecting individual cardiovascular capacities.",

            title: "Graded Exercise Test (GET)",
            explanation:
              "GET involves increasing exercise intensity under professional supervision until exhaustion. It's the most accurate method to determine MHR, providing personalized results based on actual performance.",

            title: "Field Tests",
            explanation:
              "Field tests are practical alternatives to lab-based GET, requiring individuals to reach maximum effort during high-intensity exercises like sprinting. Using a heart rate monitor to track the peak heart rate can offer insights into MHR.",

    title: "Considerations for Accurate MHR Measurement",
